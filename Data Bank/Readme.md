Danny has come up with a unique concept—Data Bank—a next-generation digital bank that combines financial services with secure, distributed cloud data storage.
Unlike traditional banks, Data Bank has no physical branches and operates entirely online, similar to the Neo-Bank model.
Here’s the catch:

Customers' cloud data storage limits are directly tied to their account balances. The more money customers have in their accounts, the more storage space they get.

The Data Bank team is focused on two key goals:

Grow their customer base rapidly in this competitive digital banking space.

Accurately forecast how much data storage capacity they will need as customers deposit more money and new customers join.
