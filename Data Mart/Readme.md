 ## The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

Data Mart has international operations using a multi-region strategy
Data Mart has both, a retail and online platform in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers
Customer segment and customer_type data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart
transactions is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and sales is the actual dollar amount of purchases
Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a week_date value which represents the start of the sales week.
